Problem 1:
Remember to include an explanation for each mis rate!

a. 100%
a[0] and a[128] will map to the same cache block and will cause conflicts. The the first loop of i , there are compulsory miss and conflict.  

b. 66.7%  (or 100%)
a[127] and a[254] will be in the same cache block if a[0] is aligned. In the first loop, there will be 2 compulsory misses and one conflict miss. After that there are 2 conflict miss in each loop, causing a miss rate (3+2*9999)/30000=66.67%. 
If a[0] is aligned at the end of first cache block, this accident will cause a[127] and a[254] be in the same place, which causes the miss rateto be 100%.


Problem 3:

Part 1:
a. 1/(0.4+0.6/4)=1.81; 

b. 1/(0.4+0.6/12)=2.22;

c. 1/(0.4+0.6/infinity)=2.5;

Part 2:
The  speedup dependson the implementation of the parallel processor and parallel programming techniques. The processors also need to do IO which also costs time.
